# Dansposé

## Overview

Dansposé is a Vista application that is similar in spirit to Mac OS X's Exposé. It utilizes the Desktop Window Manager API to render live thumbnails for active, application windows and arranges them in a grid for easy switching.

A key feature of Dansposé over Exposé is the ability to define application "groups". All application windows within a group will be aggregated into the same grid cell, when the group is selected, the member windows are expanded into full view for selection.
